Neurohack Fall 2025


This project demonstrates a non-invasive approach to brain–computer interaction using natural micro-behavioral signals that are tightly coupled with cognitive intent.

Instead of relying on EEG or invasive neural hardware, we use high-resolution eye movements, subtle facial muscle activations, and head gestures as a proxy for the user’s internal decision-making. 

This matters because these signals are fast, reliable, universally accessible, and require no special equipment—showing a path toward everyday BCI interactions.

By turning gaze and micro-expressions into a telekinetic control system, we illustrate how future BCIs can merge computer vision, human cognition, and natural behavior to create interfaces that feel effortless and intuitive. This is a step toward “thought-adjacent” interaction—technology responding to what you intend, not what you physically do.
